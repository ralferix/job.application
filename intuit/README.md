The Problem: Build a REST service using directions here :  https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/getting-started.html
Add a maven plugin to automatically increment the build number with each build.  VIM indent:   m'ggVG=''
Add code to a private repo in github.com
Setup jenkins on a local box.
Implement following path to trigger build job.
Add a script that monitors github commits.
As soon PR is  submitted
Merge the PR into develop branch.
Run a build.
(Assume PR will not be in conflict during merge, donâ€™t worry about boundary conditions, assume best case scenario)
Deploy the application manually & show it running.
