  The Problem:
   
   Build a REST service using directions here :  https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/getting-started.html
   Add a maven plugin to automatically increment the build number with each build.
indent:   m'ggVG=''
   Add code to a private repo in github.com
    
    Setup jenkins on a local box.
     
     Implement following path to trigger build job.
     Add a script that monitors github commits.
     As soon PR is  submitted
     Merge the PR into develop branch.
     Run a build.
     (Assume PR will not be in conflict during merge, donâ€™t worry about boundary conditions, assume best case scenario)
      
      Deploy the application manually & show it running.
